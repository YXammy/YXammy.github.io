I am a Computer Science major at California State University Fullerton and I plan on graduating in 2027.


## Favorite CPSC 120L labs

* Lab 07, part 1 
  I enjoyed this lab since it taught me how to interact with different codes and functions in a more logical and mathematical approach. It produced such a different output since the math and logistics don't feel like they'll compile but rather work and interact with one another. With that, I liked the code it generated and the ability to calculate the distance between two dates and display the result. Also, how it interacts with a real-world date and provides the user with input that appears helpful.

* Lab 09, part 1
  This lab is one of my favorites because of the math and the combination. I enjoyed the process of calculating an average, imputed scores, and using the application. Also, using the understanding that a user input is easy to compile and subtract unwanted to unneeded amount or item that was typed. It also taught me how to determine the greatest and least sums in a set of numbers.

* Lab 11, part2
  Depending on which number is selected, the lab receives input from the user and output from the computer. Our initial game was a guessing game in which the user could utilize numbers to figure out and guess what the machine produced number was. It used both the concept of number difference and user input to generate a response. This makes me appreciate and like the lab because it educates me about random variables.
